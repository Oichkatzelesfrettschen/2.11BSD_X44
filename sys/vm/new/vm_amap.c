/*
 * what is ppref?   ppref is an _optional_ amap feature which is used
 * to keep track of reference counts on a per-page basis.  it is enabled
 * when UVM_AMAP_PPREF is defined.
 *
 * when enabled, an array of ints is allocated for the pprefs.  this
 * array is allocated only when a partial reference is added to the
 * map (either by unmapping part of the amap, or gaining a reference
 * to only a part of an amap).  if the malloc of the array fails
 * (M_NOWAIT), then we set the array pointer to PPREF_NONE to indicate
 * that we tried to do ppref's but couldn't alloc the array so just
 * give up (after all, this is an optional feature!).
 *
 * the array is divided into page sized "chunks."   for chunks of length 1,
 * the chunk reference count plus one is stored in that chunk's slot.
 * for chunks of length > 1 the first slot contains (the reference count
 * plus one) * -1.    [the negative value indicates that the length is
 * greater than one.]   the second slot of the chunk contains the length
 * of the chunk.   here is an example:
 *
 * actual REFS:  2  2  2  2  3  1  1  0  0  0  4  4  0  1  1  1
 *       ppref: -3  4  x  x  4 -2  2 -1  3  x -5  2  1 -2  3  x
 *              <----------><-><----><-------><----><-><------->
 * (x = don't care)
 *
 * this allows us to allow one int to contain the ref count for the whole
 * chunk.    note that the "plus one" part is needed because a reference
 * count of zero is neither positive or negative (need a way to tell
 * if we've got one zero or a bunch of them).
 *
 * here are some in-line functions to help us.
