UFML FS (UFS / FFS / MFS / LFS): 
Modular Filesystem Layer For Content Address Based Storage
Inspired from Plan 9's Fossil & Venti Filesystems.

UFML:
- LOFS/NULLFS Based
- UFML Upper layer:
	- 
	- Union mounts?
	- Features: Format Support
		- Archive: tar, cpio, ar
		- Checksums:
		- Encryption: twofish
		- Compression: bzip2, gzip, lzip, lzma, xz
		- Snapshots: 
- UFML Lower Layer: (Support)
	- UFS
	- FFS
	- MFS
	- LFS 
	
Design Objectives of UFML:
- A modular filesystem layer that can provide additional features to UFS, FFS, MFS & LFS.
- Allow the interaction between one or more of these filesystems. In a similar way to how Fossil & Venti work on Plan 9. With one filesystem being the store for another.
