## Development: (Folder: devel)
- The "devel" folder is temporary.
- Contains code that fits into two categories. 1). In Development & 2). Needs Testing.
- Please look at the README for more information.

### Devel Contents:
- HTBC: HTree Based Blockchain to augment LFS & other existing Log-Structured Filesystems (akin to Soft-updates & WAPBL).
- Malloc: A Tertiary Buddy System Allocator (No Plans or use cases). Originally planned as part of a larger memory allocation stack for the kernel. (Needs a home!)
- PMAP: Clustered Page Table variant, backed by a two red-black trees.
- Scheduler: A Stackable Scheduler that sits atop 2.11BSD's existing scheduler.
  - Consists of a Hybrid EDF/CFS scheduling algorithm.
- Threads: kernel-space & user-space threading implementation.
- UFML: LOFS based filesystem layer, combined with features from HTBC.
  - Aims to provide a Fossil + Venti inspired support to UFS, FFS, MFS & LFS.
  - Planned features include: snapshots, versioning, cache, archive, compression & encryption.
- UFS211: Direct port of 2.11BSD's UFS Filesystem.
- VM: Updates to the VM Layer.
  - VM Map: Implements a red-black tree & circular list, with the intended goal of constant-time lookup.

Development Folder:
- HTBC: HTree Blockchain
	- A Versioning, Snapshot, Cache augmentation for LFS and other Log-Structured Filesystems.
	- Using a blockchain styled structure
	- Implemented in both LFS and the VFS Layer
- Memory:
	- An general memory allocator with several layers/ stack.
	- Idea: Top(Interface) to Bottom(Block Allocation) Layers: Slabs, Pools, Buckets, Tertiary Buddy
- MPX: Multiplexors
	- A reimplementation of multiplexors from the V7 and early BSD's
	- Two concurrent versions:
		- MPX: Based on bsd sockets
		- MPX-FS: A filesystem, with multiple possible variations
			- Implement in the VFS layer. To provide a multiplexors across filesystems
			- Independent FS like fdesc, fifo, etc
- Multitasking:
	- Threads
	- Threadpools
	- Deadlocking: Mutexes, Reader-Writer Lock
- OVL:
	- A Seperate overlay address space for kernel & VM (devel)
- Pmap:
	- Machine-independent api for Clustered Page Tables variation.
	- i386 arch partial pmap implementation
- Scheduler: Stacked Scheduler
	- Kernel feeds EDF which feeds the CFS. Circuler Queue
	- Earliest Deadline First Priorities (Plan 9's EDFI Inspired)
	- Completely Fair Scheduler
- UFML:
	- UFML is an abbrievation of the filesystems it's designed for (UFS + FFS + MFS + LFS)  
	- A content based filesystem/layer inspired by Plan 9's Fossil & Venti Filesystem
	- Provides a modular unified layer for archiving, snapshots and compression across UFS, FFS, MFS & LFS
- UFS211:
	- 2.11BSD's UFS. (Seperate from UFS)
- VM:
	- A 4.4BSD-Lite2 VM with features from NetBSD's UVM
