# HTBC (HTree Blockchain):
- Modify structures under htbc layout and htbc htree.
	- htbc_transaction_len/htbc_transaction_inodes_len:
		- use to compute the blockchain (i.e. number of blocks is length of blockchain)
		- insert an inode/htree into each block
		- htbc_ino (should be part of blockchain)
	- Inodes & HTree:
		- Specifically struct htbc_hc_blocklist, htbc_hc_inodelist
		- These are double ups on structures present in htbc htree and should be merged
		- htbc_inodetrk_init, htbc_inodetrk_free, htbc_inodetrk_get, 
		- htbc_register_inode, htbc_unregister_inode
	- Transactions/Blockchain:
		- Merge htbc_entry & htbc_hchain
		- Do the same thing. 
	- Journalling & Logs:
		- integrate later
		- Merge struct htbc_hi_fs & htbc_hc_header
