 * This implements the sleep(3) function using only 3 system calls instead of 
 * the 9 that the old implementation required.  Also this version avoids using
 * signals (with the attendant system overhead) and returns the amount of 
 * time left unslept if an interrupt occurs.
 *
 * The error status of gettimeofday is not checked because if that fails the
 * program has scrambled the stack so badly that a sleep() failure is the least
 * problem the program has.  The select() call either completes successfully
 * or is interrupted - no errors to be checked for.
